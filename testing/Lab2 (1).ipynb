        "For my deviation graph, I used a spine graph which splits a value into two contrasting components. This was to emphasize the variation between the points of the winning and losing teams throughout the years. This shows the margin of victory that most teams had during their wins in each year. The graph demonstrates that in the late 1980s winning teams scored the most points. Losing teams also scored their highest average of points during this time period which would indicate that the games during those seasons were fast paced and high scoring. This graph allows the viewer to compare different eras of the game in an easily understandle way."

A ranked bar graph helped me portray this in an understandle and clean looking manner. I found that their did not seem to be any correlation and that overtimes seem to be a pretty random occurance, regardless of the time period of basketball the game was played in. This makes sense, as teams adjust to each other as the season goes on which results in close games and a higher amount of overtimes as a result."

Twice in the late 1990s a team barely scored forty points and still managed to win and advance in the tournament, but in 2017 no team scored less than sixty points in a game that they won. Teams such as Virginia are notorious for grinding out low scoring wins and many teams have tried to model that strategy of perfecting their defensive abilities rather than their offense."
